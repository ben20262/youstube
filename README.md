 # Youstube

This project is my version of making youtube in my own small way. While I might lack the staff, funding, advertising capability, and all around experience and knowledge of this tech giant, I do believe that I can make a comparable product within the week that this project should be done by.

Install
After cloning this run bundle install then rails db:migrate to set up the database. Finally, run bin/run to start the local server and navigate to localhost:3000 to use the application.
